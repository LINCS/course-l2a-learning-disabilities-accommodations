               <title>What are accommodations?</title>
               <cctext><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Accommodations adjust the manner in which instructional, testing, and employment situations are presented or evaluated, so that an individual with learning disabilities can demonstrate his or her knowledge in a fair and equitable fashion.  Accommodations may involve adjustments in the presentation of instructional or testing material, the manner in which the student responds to the material, the actual scheduling or time allotted for the activity, and the setting of the test or activity.  Accommodations individualize instruction to meet diverse learning levels and are legally mandated.  These instructions may include combining oral instruction with visual handouts or reading aloud material that is too difficult for a learner.</FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">There are four key features of accommodations.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">First, accommodations are individualized to emphasize a person&apos;s strengths and work around their weaknesses, as well as the demands of the situation.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Second, accommodations require documentation from a licensed clinician who is trained to administer diagnostic testing for learning disabilities.  This documentation will help determine the needs of the individual and the most appropriate type of accommodation.  However, if documentation is unavailable, the instructor should use his or her best judgment to assist the student in class.</FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Third, the accommodations made will not interfere with the skill or concept being taught.  For instance, if reading decoding is the skill being measured on a test, a person reading the test to the student might not be an acceptable accommodation. However, if science knowledge is the skill being measured on the test, a person reading the test to a student so they can answer the questions might be a reasonable accommodation.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Fourth, accommodations for documented learning disabilities provide access to a learning environment to which all Americans are entitled.  The Legal Right of Access for students with disabilities is derived from several federal laws, including the 14th Amendment, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, the Equal Opportunity Act of 1974, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">To learn about accommodations, click the resource icon.  </FONT></P>,,</cctext>

Hamid is taking adult basic education classes to improve his reading skills so he can complete his General Education Development test, regularly referred to as the GED. Hamid emigrated from Iran when he was five years old. He was diagnosed with a Learning Disability (LD) when in the public schools. Unfortunately, he has no past evaluation documentation from his high school years to provide support for accessing accommodations on the GED. Now that you have heard Hamid&apos;s story, please answer the following questions. </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Hamid&apos;s Accomodations button audio after questions: </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">The majority of adolescents and adults with learning disabilities (LD) demonstrate difficulties with the speed of processing literacy tasks (Gregg, 2009). Therefore, recognizing that Hamid has a long history of LD, the adult basic education (ABE) teacher might consider providing him extra time on instructional and testing tasks. However, if Hamid requests the accommodation of extra time on a high stakes test such as the GED, he must provide current psychological documentation.</FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">The adult basic education teacher who is working with Hamid on improving his reading skills found the following classroom accommodations to be effective: (1) extra time for instructional and testing situations; (2) quiet room during testing; and (3) font size of textbooks enlarged.</FONT></P></cctext>

               <cctext><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Next, we will discuss the different types of accommodations in detail.

               <cctext><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">The first type of accommodation we will discuss is presentation.  Presentation accommodations provide individuals access to content by alternative means.  These alternatives include reading aloud, alternative media, language structures, and font format.  </FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0"></FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Reading aloud accommodations include the use of a screen reader or a human reader. For the majority of individuals with learning disabilities, read-alouds, or the oral presentation of print materials, are the most frequent accommodation requests. While alternative media include e-Text and audio books,  language structure accommodations include simplified syntax and plain English, while font format accommodations include the use of large print or color font. </FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0"></FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Adult basic education learners with approved documentation can request GED test presentation accommodations in various formats including: Braille, audio cassette format, large print, straight edge guide to facilitate reading, and colored overlays. It is generally acknowledged that colored overlays have no empirical research base.  Additionally, as the General Education Development Testing Service agency interprets read-alouds as an exception to their accommodation policy, they do require special permission.  In the near future, the accommodation of text-to-speech should be more readily available for the Adult Basic Education learner to access during the GED test administration. </FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0"></FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">There are several resources students can access to assist their learning experience.

               <title>Presentation Accommodations - Billy Scenario </title>
               <cctext><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Let&apos;s take a look at another scenario of a student who may need accommodations to achieve optimal performance in a learning environment.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">After you listen to the scenario, review the following questions and select the best response. </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Billy, a nineteen-year old European American, comes from a rural farming community where he was identified as demonstrating LD in first grade. His reading decoding and comprehension skills have continued to be a critical area of underachievement for him throughout his elementary and secondary schooling. Unfortunately, Billy was unable to pass his high school graduation reading and writing tests so he dropped out of school. Billy would like to attend a technical college, but he needs the GED to be accepted into the institution. Therefore, he is going to adult basic education classes to help him prepare for taking the GED examination. He does not have documentation for GED testing accommodations.</FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Billy&apos;s Presentation Accomodations button audio after questions: </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Due to Billy&apos;s significant deficits with reading decoding and reading comprehension, accommodations specific to print access are critical for him. Researchers have provided a great deal of empirical evidence for the critical role reading fluency plays in high speed word recognition and comprehension of text (National Reading Panel, 2000). Therefore, as with Hamid, Billy should be provided the accommodation of extra time on literacy tasks due to his reading decoding and comprehension deficits that interfere with reading fluency. In addition, various new technologies are being used to accommodate the learning and work environments for adolescents and adults with LD. For Billy, alternative media such as electronic text (e-Text) and the software (text-to-speech) to access e-Text are critical tools for acquiring print. Text-to-speech software can enable the reading of a computer display, or it may simply be used to augment the reading of text message.</FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Vocational rehabilitation services assisted Billy in obtaining an evaluation to have the documentation required for receiving accommodations on the GED test and for reading accommodations in the classroom.  The following reading accommodations would be most effective for Billy: (1) extra time; (2) scheduled breaks; (3) electronic text (e-Text); (4) text-to-speech software; and (5) embedded e-Text supports for his reading assignments. </FONT></P></cctext>

               <title>What kinds of accommodations are available?-Response </title>
               <cctext><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">The second accommodation we will discuss is response.  Response accommodations allow an individual equal opportunity to demonstrate knowledge by using alternative forms of response that demonstrate their skills by avoiding means of expression affected by their learning disability.  For many students this means accommodations that lessen their writing demands.  Alternative responses may include writing in a test booklet or giving oral responses.  Writing directly in a test booklet allows the student to forego the scanned &quot;bubble&quot; sheet.  Utilizing access assistants, or scribes, allows the student to forego writing all together.  Scribes write only what the student dictates, they do not edit, and they must be trained.  Commonly requested assistive technologies include word processing with spell check, abbreviation expanders, and outlining software programs.  Voice recognition or speech-to-text is also an accommodation during GED testing, but would require a specific exception to the current testing policy. Other response accommodations include graphic organizers and calculation devices.  To receive a calculator accommodation which may be adapted with large keys or voice output, a student must have a disability in the area of math or writing.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Click the resource icon to learn about additional resources available to students for response accommodations.</FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Resource button audio:</FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Text-to-speech software allows students to use alternative means to provide responses where written communication may be difficult for those with learning disabilities.  A variety of freeware and shareware is also available on the Internet to assist with text-to-speech.  Readplease.com is a commercial Windows-based text-to-speech software, while tucows.com offers access to numerous shareware and free software.  Talk-to-me.net is an information-based website that offers useful articles on headsets and speech recognition software.  It&apos;s a great place to research text-to-speech.  Finally, lakefolks.org offers Click-N-Type.  Click-N-Type is a free on-screen virtual keyboard designed for anyone with a disability that prevents him or her from typing on a physical computer keyboard.

As with the previous adults presented throughout this course, individuals with LD often experience difficulty quickly processing literacy tasks, such as mathematics symbols. Therefore, extra time on math tests for someone like Juan is an appropriate accommodation. Many of the same underlying processing deficits that interfere with an adult&apos;s ability to spell words also impact their ability to write numbers. For Juan, the ability to utilize a calculator will enable him to access the symbols quickly and accurately during a math problem. The use of read alouds (text-to-speech or a reader) also allow Juan, a poor reader, to access the math problems.  Read alouds are commonly used accommodations on many high stakes math tests. </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">The ABE teacher has found the following instructional accommodations to help improve Juan&apos;s performance during instruction and on classroom tests: (1) extra time; (2) calculator; (3) reducing the verbal instructions on math tests; and (4) using a reader to help Juan understand the math requirements on tasks. </FONT></P></cctext>

Instructional accommodations are accommodations made in the classroom based on the student&apos;s abilities, the student&apos;s results, and the instructor&apos;s assessment of their situation and his or her best judgment. </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Testing accommodations refer to high-stakes tests such as the GED.  These accommodations have restrictions and require more specific documentation before they can be implemented.</FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Now that we have defined accommodations and its features, we will discuss how to access these accommodations.  There are three essential steps each person must take to gain access to accommodations.  They are self-determination, self-disclosure, and self-advocacy.</FONT></P></cctext>

               <title>How to access accommodations -Self-Determination </title>
               <cctext><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">The first step to accessing accommodations is self-determination. This means that an individual has a positive yet realistic understanding of his or her strengths and weaknesses, and can choose a path in life that is satisfying and leads to success.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">The learner also recognizes that he or she may need some assistance in performing certain tasks.  It is important to be able to ask for help and recognize when accommodations are needed.  The concept of self-determination applies to us all, whether we have a disability or not.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Self-Determination requires the learner to plan for their future by setting goals and the steps required to achieve those goals.  Learners must also be proactive by gaining support and taking advantage of resources to ensure success.  Learners must also reflect by evaluating differences between expected outcome, performance, and actual outcome, and then readjusting for next time.  Self-determination also requires learners to gain self-awareness as well as learn to value his or her self. </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Some key questions to help individuals gain self-awareness are:  What are my areas of strength?  What is difficult for me?  What do I enjoy?  What is important to me?  How well do I understand my learning disability? And how can I explain my learning disability?</FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Knowing the answers to these questions helps individuals learn to value themselves by accepting one&apos;s strengths and weakness, and then take responsibility for both successes and failures. </FONT></P></cctext>

               <title>Accessing Accommodations - Case Study</title>
               <cctext><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Let&apos;s take a look at a case study to understand the importance of accessing accommodations.</FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Kathy was diagnosed with learning disabilities (LD) in first grade and received special education services throughout her elementary and secondary schooling. She is a very talented artist who struggles in the ability to read and write. Unfortunately, she was never able to pass her high school graduation tests to receive a diploma. After working with a graphic artist for a few years, several opportunities for advancing her job were suggested by her employer. However, any advancement is dependent upon her ability to complete her GED and attend postsecondary schooling that leads to specialized credentials. </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">In relation to self-awareness, Kathy is very aware of her academic strengths and weaknesses. However, she demonstrates difficulties in explaining how her abilities could be accommodated such that postsecondary schooling would be possible for her. New advances in technology, such as text-to-speech and speech-to-text software might provide her the tools for success.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Kathy has been able to disclose her reading and writing problems with her employer, and she has received positive feedback. Therefore, her ability to disclose her disabilities with service providers working to help her access accommodations in postsecondary education classes will seem more familiar to her. These service providers might also help her better understand her LD as she reviews with them her past and current psychological documentation. </FONT></P></cctext>

               <title>How to access accommodations -Self-Disclosure</title>
               <cctext><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">The next step to accessing accommodations is the act of self-disclosure. This is an important sub-skill of self-determination.  It is particularly important for individuals with hidden disabilities.  The act of self-disclosure usually means three things:  accepting the disability, obtaining documentation, and revealing the disability to others.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Self-disclosure could prevent a learning disability from being misinterpreted as a lack of competence; however, the decision to self-disclose should be made by each individual in light of his or her circumstances.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Self-disclosure is necessary for an adult with learning disabilities in an adult basic education program because in order to receive accommodations, one must share personal information about his or her disability.  As a learning disability is generally a hidden disability, adults must decide where, when, what, and how to disclose.  Adults must provide documentation that includes how the disability affects performance, as well as a list of reasonable accommodations. </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">The advantages of self-disclosure are:  accommodations, support network, improved self-advocacy, and legal protection against discrimination.  Despite these advantages, some adults choose not to self-disclose.  Their reasons can vary from sense of exclusion, sense of weakness, or high evaluation costs. </FONT></P></cctext>

               <title>How to access accommodations -Self-Advocacy </title>
               <cctext><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">The final step to accessing accommodations is self-advocacy.  This is a skill that goes beyond self-disclosure.  Self-advocacy includes the individual&apos;s ability to understand the types of accommodations he or she needs, as well as the ability to convey to teachers, testing entities, and employers that specific accommodations are required. </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">For example, someone who has a documented learning disability may require audio assistance when taking an exam.  This person should first inquire about his or her options in the classroom.  In the case that no in-class accommodations are available, such as headphones, then setting accommodations may be necessary, such as a change to another room for read-aloud options. </FONT></P></cctext>

               <title>Universal Design </title>
               <cctext><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Now let&apos;s explore the concept of Universal Design.  Many individuals in the field of adult basic education suggest that we develop learning, testing, and work environments so that any person, with or without disabilities, could access accommodations.  To assist facilities and companies making these accommodations, Universal Design offers a proactive approach.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">The Universal Design (UD) concept offers accessible design features and minimizes the need for individually or retrofitted accommodations.  This means that companies can build accommodations into their programs and facilities to make them more accessible.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Some examples of the Universal Design concept already common in our everyday lives include such changes as news station utilizing closed-captioning for the hearing impaired, or municipalities creating curb-cuts for individuals in wheelchairs.  These universal design changes were originally meant to accommodate those with disabilities; today they have a much wider scope by assisting all people who use these services or are exposed to these services. </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">With a Universal Design approach, alternative media would be more accessible to the entire population without calling specific attention to those with learning disabilities.  Universal Design is more about ease of use for all individuals.  Fortunately, a growing number of the population is advocating the importance of alternative media and assistive technologies.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Some of the more widely heralded technologies include e-Text for books, magazines, and newspapers; as well as mobile phone devices as a means to scan text or download e-Text to laptops for work or school.  e-Text is fast becoming the medium of choice for a large percentage of the general population-with or without print reading disabilities.  One of the reasons for the increasing popularity of e-Text among adolescents and adults with learning disabilities is its portability.  Digital files can be quickly downloaded and used in a variety of environments. Mobile phone usage is also on the rise.  For adolescents or adults with learning disabilities, the phone offers a quick and comprehensive tool for managing the day-to-day reading and writing tasks both at school and work.  </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Providing individuals with learning disabilities training on how to access and use these new technologies is key to making these accommodations more commonplace.  A learning strategies approach in which students or workers are taught how and when to use an accommodation is essential to a positive outcome.   For example, training in active listening, how to use assistive technologies, and extended time allowances to gain proficiency are important activities to teach those with learning disabilities how to best structure, manage, and organize time. </FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Understanding that learning is fluid and dynamic is key to ensuring ongoing education, particularly for individuals with learning disabilities.  For most of us, it begins with reading.  Those with learning disabilities often become discouraged and do not even contemplate postsecondary educational opportunities.  In the world of work, many of these individuals are underemployed or lose their jobs when reading becomes essential to their employment.  The profound changes in the digital world show encouraging signs that more and more people with learning disabilities will benefit from tools that incorporate universal design and ensure ease of use for all users.</FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0" /></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">Audio for Resource button:</FONT></P>,,,<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="10" COLOR="#000000" LETTERSPACING="0" KERNING="0">The goal of Universal Design is to provide the best environment for equal access to resources.
