        <title>Presentation accommodations provide access to content through alternative methods</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this topic, we will take a
closer look at presentation accommodations, which provide individuals access to
content by alternative means. These alternatives include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;reading aloud, which may involve the use of a
screen reader or a human reader;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;alternative media, which includes the use of
e-Text and audio books;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;language structures, which include simplified
syntax and plain English; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;font format, which include the use of large
print or different font colors.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;For the
majority of individuals with learning disabilities, read-alouds, or the oral
presentation of print materials, are the most frequent accommodation requests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For
example, adult basic education learners with approved documentation can request
GED test presentation accommodations in various formats including: Braille,
audio format, large print, straight edge guide to facilitate reading, and
colored overlays. Note that it is generally acknowledged that the use of colored overlays has no empirical research base (Ritchie et al., 2011; Denton &amp;amp; Meindl, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;More Information&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GED Testing Service considers
test accommodations on a case-by-case basis. Documentation guidelines for
learning and cognitive disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder,
psychological and psychiatric disorders, and physical disabilities and chronic
health conditions are available on the &lt;a href="https://ged.com/about_test/accommodations/" target="_blank"&gt;GED Testing Service&amp;nbsp;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Presentation accommodation resources</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several types of resources students can access to
assist their learning experience. These include electronic and audio
alternative media. Electronic alternative media offers resources to augment
reading experiences for students. Resources include &lt;a href="http://www.bookshare.org" target="_blank"&gt;Bookshare.org&lt;/a&gt;,
an ebook library supported by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of
Special Education Programs. U.S. students with a qualifying print disability may &lt;a href="https://www.bookshare.org/cms/bookshare-me/who-qualifies" target="_blank"&gt;join

        <title>Does Billy qualify for accommodations?</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at another scenario of a student who may
need accommodations to achieve optimal performance in a learning
environment.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read Billy’s story, then determine whether he qualifies
for accommodations.&lt;img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/Billy.png" alt="Billy, a young man of European descent" width="153" height="212" class="img-responsive atto_image_button_right"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Billy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Billy, a nineteen-year-old European American, comes from a rural
farming community where he was identified as demonstrating LD in first grade.
His reading decoding and comprehension skills have continued to be a critical
area of underachievement for him throughout his elementary and secondary
schooling. Unfortunately, Billy was unable to pass the &amp;nbsp;state language arts tests, so he dropped out
of school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billy would like to attend a
technical college, but he needs the GED to be accepted into the institution.
Therefore, he is taking some ABE classes to help him prepare for taking the GED
examination. He does not have documentation for GED testing accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Based on the information provided, does Billy qualify for GED
accommodations?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol type="a"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

farming community where he was identified as demonstrating LD in first grade.
His reading decoding and comprehension skills have continued to be a critical
area of underachievement for him throughout his elementary and secondary schooling.
Unfortunately, Billy was unable to pass his high school graduation reading and

Therefore, he is taking some ABE classes to help him prepare for taking the GED
examination. He does not have documentation for GED testing accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you had to select reading accommodations for Billy, what would you
choose?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol type="a"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extra time for instructional and testing situations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Text-to-speech software&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scheduled breaks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All of the above&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correct answer is d: all of the above. Based on the
information provided, appropriate reading accommodations may include &lt;b&gt;extra time for instructional and testing
situations, text-to-speech software, and scheduled breaks&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/Billy.png" alt="Billy, a young man of European descent" width="153" height="212" class="img-responsive atto_image_button_right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span&gt;Billy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 

 
 
Billy, a nineteen-year-old European American, comes from a rural
farming community where he was identified as demonstrating LD in first grade.
His reading decoding and comprehension skills have continued to be a critical
area of underachievement for him throughout his elementary and secondary
schooling. Unfortunately, Billy was unable to pass his high school graduation
reading and writing tests, so he dropped out of school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billy would like to attend a
technical college, but he needs the GED to be accepted into the institution.
Therefore, he is taking some ABE classes to help him prepare for taking the GED
examination. He does not have documentation for GED testing accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to Billy's significant deficits with reading decoding
and reading comprehension, accommodations specific to print access are critical
for him. Researchers have provided a great deal of empirical evidence for the
critical role reading fluency plays in high speed word recognition and
comprehension of text (National Reading Panel, 2000). Therefore, like Hamid,
Billy should be provided the accommodation of extra time on literacy tasks due
to his reading decoding and comprehension deficits that interfere with reading
fluency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, various new technologies are being used to
accommodate the learning and work environments for adolescents and adults with
LD. For Billy, alternative media such as electronic text (e-Text) and the
software to access e-Text (text-to-speech) are critical tools for acquiring
print. Text-to-speech software can enable the reading of a computer display, or
it may simply be used to augment the reading of text message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocational rehabilitation services assisted Billy in
obtaining an evaluation to have the documentation required for receiving
accommodations on the GED test and for reading accommodations in the classroom.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
